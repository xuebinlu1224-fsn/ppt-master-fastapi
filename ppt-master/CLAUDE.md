# CLAUDE.md

This file is the project entry point for Claude Code.

**You MUST read [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) before any PPT generation task or repo modification.** This repository exists to generate presentations; SKILL.md is the authoritative workflow that owns project creation, role switching, serial execution, quality gates, post-processing, export, and every per-step command. The rest of this file only points to where related material lives — it never substitutes for SKILL.md.

## Project Overview

PPT Master is an AI-driven presentation generation system. Multi-role collaboration (Strategist → Image_Generator → Executor) converts source documents (PDF/DOCX/URL/Markdown) into natively editable PPTX with real PowerPoint shapes (DrawingML).

**Core Pipeline**: `Source Document → Create Project → [Template] → Strategist Eight Confirmations → [Image_Generator] → Executor Live Preview → Quality Check → Post-processing → Export PPTX`

> Topic-only requests with no source material: run the standalone [`topic-research`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/topic-research.md) workflow before SKILL.md Step 1 to gather web materials.
>
> Template fill: when the user provides an existing `.pptx` template plus text materials or a topic and asks to reuse the original PPT design or fill content back into it (for example, "fill this deck with the new content", "fill this back into the template", or "reuse this deck's design"), run the standalone [`template-fill-pptx`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/template-fill-pptx.md) workflow. This route edits PPTX directly and must not enter the SVG generation pipeline.
>
> Beautify / re-layout: when the user provides an existing `.pptx` and asks to beautify or re-layout it while keeping the content (for example, "把这份 PPT 美化一下", "重新排版，内容别动", or wants to paste the regenerated elements back into the original deck), run the standalone [`beautify-pptx`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/beautify-pptx.md) workflow. Mirror of template-fill: content is preserved verbatim, the source's palette/fonts are inherited as truth, only layout is redesigned. Unlike template-fill, it regenerates a native deck through the SVG pipeline (Strategist → Executor → export), one source slide to one page; it does not edit the source in place. Routing boundary — beautify is for "keep this deck, just lay it out better": page count and page order are preserved 1:1. If the original page breakdown itself should be reconsidered (merge / split / reorder pages, re-outline the structure), that is NOT beautify: convert the deck with [`ppt_to_md`](skills/ppt-master/scripts/source_to_md/ppt_to_md.py) and run the main SKILL.md pipeline, where the Strategist re-architects the outline freely from the extracted content. The discriminator is page count / order: any change to it — split, merge, drop, reorder, even just splitting a crowded page so it reads better — is the main pipeline; beautify is strictly 1:1. Decide by one question: is the source's page split information to preserve, or just the previous author's structure to improve?
>
> Phase B resumption (split-mode execution): when the user opens a fresh chat and says "继续生成 projects/<x>" or similar, run the standalone [`resume-execute`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/resume-execute.md) workflow to enter Phase B (SVG generation + export) without re-running Phase A.
>
> Spec refinement (opt-in): when the user explicitly asks to refine / review / revise the spec before generation (for example "refine the spec first", "review the spec before generating", "send me the spec to confirm first"), run the standalone [`refine-spec`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/refine-spec.md) workflow. Strategist produces the full `design_spec.md` + `spec_lock.md` first, then stops so the user can revise any part of it (outline, color, typography, layout, image strategy, …) before any image or SVG work; on approval the pipeline resumes at Step 5/6. Default is OFF — no request means the spec is written in one pass and the pipeline auto-proceeds. Surfaced as an opt-in line in the Eight Confirmations, same shape as the split-mode note; never enter it unprompted.
>
> Decks containing data charts: run the standalone [`verify-charts`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/verify-charts.md) workflow between the executor and post-processing steps to calibrate chart coordinates.
>
> Recorded narration / video export: run the standalone [`generate-audio`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/generate-audio.md) workflow after post-processing.
>
> Object-level animation tuning: when the user asks to change animation order, effect, timing, or a specific object's reveal behavior, run the standalone [`customize-animations`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/customize-animations.md) workflow. Default export applies page transitions but no per-element entrance animation (element builds are opt-in); create `animations.json` or pass `-a auto` only when the user asks for element animation or object-level customization.
>
> Live preview: any time the user mentions "live preview", "preview", "看效果", or wants to click/select a slide element, run [`live-preview`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/live-preview.md). Step 6 auto-starts it during generation; the workflow covers post-export re-entry and applying submitted annotations.
>
> Brand identity setup: when the user asks to "set up brand" / "建立品牌" / "做品牌规范", provides a brand asset (logo / brand site URL / branded PPTX / brand PDF), or wants to extract a brand from existing materials, run the standalone [`create-brand`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-brand.md) workflow. Output goes to `skills/ppt-master/templates/brands/<id>/`. Brands apply at SKILL.md Step 3 via the same explicit-path rule as layout templates — the user supplies the brand directory path to apply it; bare brand names never trigger.
>
> Visual self-check: only when the user explicitly requests a per-page visual review on the generated SVGs (e.g., "跑一下视觉自检 / 视觉回看 / 视觉 rubric", "visual review", "check each page visually"), run the standalone [`visual-review`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/visual-review.md) workflow between the executor and post-processing steps. The main pipeline does NOT invoke it automatically; do not infer or recommend it from deck size, model identity, or any other signal — user request is the only trigger.

## Execution Requirements

- For standalone template creation (no source deck), read [`skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md).
- Technical SVG/PPT constraints live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md).
- Canvas choices live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md).
- Icon library details live in [`skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md`](skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md).

## Required Conventions

- **Repo-wide style rules** — when editing prompt files under [`skills/ppt-master/references/`](skills/ppt-master/references/), Python under [`skills/ppt-master/scripts/`](skills/ppt-master/scripts/), or any other code/prose in the repo, follow the matching style rule in [`docs/rules/`](docs/rules/).
- **Markdown language consistency** — Markdown files under `skills/ppt-master/workflows/`, `skills/ppt-master/references/`, and `docs/` are currently single-language per directory. New files mirror the language of their siblings; do not mix English scaffolding with Chinese paragraphs (or vice versa) inside one file. Chat replies are unaffected.

## Compatibility Boundary

- This repository is a workflow/skill package, not an app or service scaffold.
- Do NOT assume generic-project conventions like `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, or mandatory branch setup unless the user explicitly requests them.
- On conflict with a generic coding skill, prioritize [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) inside this repository.
